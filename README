Commands

Here are the usual IRC commands that seem to work so far:

/nick nickname
	Changes your current IRC nick to `nickname'
/server server
	Disconnects from the current server and connects to `server'
/connect server
	Connects to `server'
/disconnect
	Disconnects from the current server
/join #channel1 #channel2
	Join a channel
/part
	Parts from a channel
/names
	Get a list of people in the current channel
/allnames
	(full list if /names is bigger than a page)
/quit [quit message]
	Quit bfirc with optional quit message.
/whois [user]
	Get WHOIS information for user
/topic
	No arguments: display the topic in the current channel,
	any other arguments will change the topic in the current channel.
	Due to popular demand, typing /topic [Tab] will now stick in the current
	topic so you can add to it or whatever.
/ignore
/ignoreto
	(both ignore the user AND all messages addressed to him/her
	and also any joins/parts/quits from the user)
/msg user message
	Send a private message to user
/me
	Perform an action

And here are the ones that are particular to bfirc:
/addtopic  
	This one you can use to add something to the original topic. e.g.
	If topic is "hello", /addtopic foo | , the topic will be "foo | hello"
/url
	There'll be one (at the moment) URL cached, so every time someone says
	a URL you can get to it by doing /url and it will execute the command
	you've specified in your rc file, e.g. url_action=echo %s | xclip
	Which will put the cached URL onto the X clipboard.
/urls
	No longer valid is the above statement, for there are multiple URLs
	cached. Type /urls (or hit C-e) and see a list of the last 10 URLs,
	hit a number to send it to url_action.
/id, /identify
	These two are just shortcuts to /msg nickserv identify [password]
/open user
	Open a PM buffer for a user
/close
	Close a PM buffer
/buddy
	Add someone to your buddy list and get a notification box if they
	join/leave a channel you're on.
/watch
	Watch a channel and get notifications if someone joins/leaves
	that channel
/loadrc
	Reload the settings in the rc file (except the nick setting)
/set
	e.g. /set scroll_topic=no
/away
	Basically the most kick ass away mode ever. Any words in your watchwords
	(see sample rc file) or your nick will trigger highlighting of messages
	and they'll be stored in the away mode screen so you can press up/down
	(or j/k) to go through them and see them in context, then pgup/pgdn to
	scroll through the context.
/alias
	Usage: /alias <alias> <command>
	e.g. /alias who names
	This will make /who have the same functionality as /names
	See ALIASES in sample-rc to set this permanently
/clear
	Clears the current buffer
	
Keys

Tab
	Autocomplete nicks. I think it works properly. 0.0.5: Now also auto
	completes /commands, because apparently people think that's useful.
	0.0.6: Autocomplete of cached words over a certain length (which is >= 7
	chars as of the time of as of this of as written).
	You'll see a preview, which only means anything if you hit tab, otherwise
	it's ignored in the final message
C-w
    Clear channel notifications from bottom of the screen.
C-n
	Jump to the next active buffer (starting at the left of the list), or go
	through the buffers if there's no active ones.
C-p
	Same as C-n but go the other way through the buffers.
C-u
	Clear from cursor to beginning of line in input box.
C-a
	Move cursor to beginning of line in input box.
C-r
	Enter kick ass backwards search mode (which can be safely interrupted
	with C-c in case things go a bit crazy). Regex should work, see
	http://docs.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html for reference on Python's
	regex.
C-f
	Pop up the channel list. You may select a channel by pressing the
	corresponding number.
C-e
	Show URL list (see /urls above).
PgUp/PgDn
	Indeed, scrolling, and it goes back through your logs too, because
	it's magic.
C-Left/C-Right
	Jump back/forward a word.
C-Backspace/C-Delete
	Delete a word backward or forward
Up/Down
	Go back and forth in the input buffer. Unlike irssi, which has a
	per-channel input buffer, bfirc has a global input buffer.

And finally, a step-by-step on the sample-rc you should've got in the
tarball. Note that this is all real, genuine Python code.
Firstly, some brief, essential notes on Python syntax:

	*	All strings are enclosed in quotes, either like this:
			foo = 'foo'
		or this:
			bar = "bar"
	
	*	Any parameter that has multiple values, e.g. your buddy list,
		are a Python list object, and look like this:
			foo = ['one', 'two', "three", "four", 'five']
			
	*	A dictionary is like a special list, which maps a key to a value, eg.
		your dictionary of passwords. They look like this:
			dict = {"name": "value", "bar": 345}
		Note that the value can be anything.
	
	*	Numbers are expressed without any quotes, like this:
			foo = 10
	
	*	Boolean variables, i.e. those that are either true or false,
		are set thus:
			foo = True
			bar = False

		The capitalisation of True and False is important.

LOG_ID =
	This is the subdirectory that any bfirc sessions loaded with this rc file
	will use to store your logs, regardless of nick changes.
	So if you enter "foo", your logs will all be saved in ~/.bfirc/logs/foo/
LOGS_DIR =
	Set this to be the base dir for logs, e.g. ~/.bfirc/logs/
LOGGING =
	Set to True or False to enable/disable logging, default is False.
IGNORE_TO =, IGNORE =
	Put a list (all lists are separated by commas) of people you want to
	ignore here, /ignoreto is mentioned above.
BUDDY_LIST =
	Again, a comma separated list of people to whom you want to be alerted
	when they join/leave a channel you're in.
WATCH_LIST =
	A list of channels you want to keep an eye on; you'll receive a
	notification when someone joins/leaves one of these channels.
AUTOJOIN_LIST =
	A dictionary of the format:
	{"server1": ["#channel1", "#channel2"], "server2": ["#channel3"]}
	Join these channels automatically when you connect. Note that if a server
	isn't present in this list, nothing should go wrong.
SERVER =
	A list of the servers to connect to on startup.
PORT =
	Connect on this port (default 6667).
NICK =
	Your nick.
ALTNICK =
	The nick to be used if NICK is unavailable for some reason (already logged
	in, etc.)
REALNAME =
	Your real name (e.g. John Smith)
PASS_LIST =
	A dictionary of your passwords (similar format to AUTOJOIN_LIST)
	Your passwords are not encrypted, so stash them somewhere safe.
SCROLL_TOPIC =
	Set to True or False to enable/disable fancy scrolling topic.
SHOW_EVENTS =
	Set to True or False to enable/disable join/part/quit notifications
	in the info bar.
WATCHWORDS =
	A list of words that you want to be highlighted when people say them.
	Words in this list will also be sent to your away window so you can
	read the messages later (if away mode is on). You can put regex in
	too. See http://docs.python.org/lib/re-syntax.html for reference.
NICK_COLS =
	Set to True or False to enable/disable colourisation of nicks based
	on a checksum type thing on the ordinal values of the characters
	in the nick. Apparently this makes it easier to follow conversations.
ALIASES =
	This is a dictionary for the aliases you want to use, e.g.:
	ALIASES = {
		'who' : 'names',
		'q' : 'quit'
	}
SYS_COLOURS =
	This is a dictionary of colours and it's nice and simple. First off,
	it should all be case insensitive so don't worry about that, but
	here are the valid colours:
	BLACK, RED, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE, MAGENTA, CYAN, WHITE, DEFAULT

	Now in the dictionary there are all the different "classes", so if you've
	got, e.g. "plain", it's set to "DEFAULT" (which is the default colour
	set by the terminal emulator you're running).

	If you want to change that, you'd have:
	"plain" : "BLUE",
	Or, if you want a background colour too:
	"plain" : ("BLUE", "WHITE"),
	
	Note that the parentheses are important; it won't work without them.
	And don't forget the comma at the end of the line, it's equally important.
	That's as complicated as the syntax gets, you should be able to figure
	it out from the example. I've also included an example for some pretty
	cool colours I'm using at the moment, in case you have no imagination.
INPUT_HOOKS = 
	This list allows you to place a hook on any command, e.g. /say (the default),
	/msg, /open, /join, etc., etc.. You can override the command or just
	alter the data that is sent to it. The syntax is this:
	INPUT_HOOKS = [
		(command, function),
		(command2, function2)
	]
	Your functions are defined as normal Python functions within your rc file
	and they should be defined to accept these parameters:

	def function( con, buf, cmd, args )

	con is the connection to which the command is relevant (if there is one,
	although at the moment there is only one connection anyway),

	buf is the current buffer, e.g. "#bfirc"

	cmd is the command itself. If you change this then you can effectively
	override the command.

	args are the arguments passed to the command, e.g. /msg bobf hello there!
	will send a list thus to args: [ "bobf", "hello", "there!" ]

	It is ESSENTIAL that any hook returns these arguments back to the main
	program, so you should have this as the last line in your function:

	return con, buf, cmd, args

	*** IMPORTANT: As of 0.0.8 I added a new input hook called "word".
	Here's how it works:
		INPUT_HOOKS = [ ..., ..., ("word", on_word) ]

		def on_word( word, buffer ):
			if buffer == "#whatever" and word == "hello":
				word = "Hello, everyone!"

			return word, None

	So you can use it to automatically replace words as you type, if you like.
	Perhaps a more useful use is a spellchecker. I hacked something together
	with the aspell-python module:
	http://www.wmula.republika.pl/proj/aspell-python/index.html
	and it works pretty well. The second return argument for this handler
	is the colour to display the word in, so you can check if the word's
	in a dictionary and, if it isn't, display it in red, otherwise display it in
	the normal colour. Here's the code from my rc file:

	def spell_check( s, buf ):
		if not s.isalpha():
			return s, None 

		lang = None
		if buf == "#casimir":
			lang = "fr"
			
		try:
			import aspell
			if lang:
				sp = aspell.Speller( "lang", lang )
			else:
				sp = aspell.Speller()

		except ImportError:
			raise_error( "Could not load aspell-python module, get it here: http://www.wmula.republika.pl/proj/aspell-python/index.html" )
			sp = None

		if not sp:
			return s, None

		c = sp.check( s )
		if c:
			return s, None

		return s, COLOURS["offline"]


	So there you go. If you write any hooks for bfirc please do email
	them to me so I can put them on the website and save myself from
	having to document the scripting thing any more than I have done
	here. :-)

OUTPUT_HOOKS =
	This list works similarly to INPUT_HOOKS except that it allows you to
	process events coming from the server and manipulate them. The syntax
	for the list is the same, e.g.:
	
	OUTPUT_HOOKS = [
		("privmsg", on_privmsg),
		("pubmsg", on_pubmsg)
	]

	But the function definitions are different. Instead the functions should
	be defined like this:

	def function( con, evt )

	con is the current connection.

	evt is an object with the following members:
		event_type
		source
		target
		arguments
	
	So a privmsg event from "foo" to "bar" saying "hello there!" will be:
		event_type == "privmsg"
		source == "foo"
		target == "bar"
		arguments == [ "hello", "there!" ]

	Probably the best way to learn is to just play around with it. All of
	this happens inside a try/except clause so if you break something
	you should get a nice traceback inside the program that lets you
	deal with it. This is currently how I'm developing bfirc, by implementing
	new features in my rc file and merging them, meaning I don't have
	to reload the client to test them.

	Regarding hooks, you should be aware of the following:
		"buffers" is a global variable of type dict. So buffers[ "#bfirc" ]
		will be the buffer object for #bfirc. At the moment I recommend
		looking at the source to see what you can do with it.

		irc_process_command() is probably the most useful function here.
		You can access it from any hook and it is defined like so:

		def irc_process_command( connection, command, args ):

		e.g. irc_process_command( con, "say", ["hello", "everybody!"] )

		You can also use:
			irc_process_command( con, "say", "hello everybody!" )
		And it'll convert the args into a list for you.

	I'll try to put up a few example hooks on the webpage as examples.

Roadmap

A big problem at the moment is the resizing. I can't get it to work right.
It either resizes but looks horrible and half the windows are all on top
of each other, or it (probably) works properly, except Python segfaults.
Hopefully I'll get to the bottom of that one.

Need to do some housekeeping re: processing all the currently unprocessed
IRC server messages; stuff like "You aren't an operator", "Nick not found",
etc. etc..

Numerous bugfixes, no doubt.

Thanks to Joel Rosdahl for the Python IRC lib.
It's nice and low level so I haven't been held back by it
but it's also done the boring shit for me and deals with
all the sockets probably better than if I'd done it myself.
Check the header for birclib.py (slightly modified version).
